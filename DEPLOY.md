# Deployment Guide for CoopCredit

This guide explains how to deploy the CoopCredit application on Render using the provided `render.yaml` Blueprint.

## Prerequisites

1.  **GitHub Repository**: Ensure this code is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Render Account**: Create an account at [render.com](https://render.com).

## Deployment Steps

1.  **Log in to Render**.
2.  **Create a New Blueprint Instance**:
    *   Click on **New +** and select **Blueprint**.
    *   Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already.
    *   Select the repository containing this project.
3.  **Configure the Blueprint**:
    *   Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file.
    *   It will show the services to be created:
        *   `coopcredit-db` (PostgreSQL Database)
        *   `risk-central-mock-service` (Web Service)
        *   `creddit-application-service` (Web Service)
    *   Review the plan (Free tier is selected by default).
4.  **Apply**:
    *   Click **Apply** to start the deployment.
    *   Render will create the database first, then build and deploy the services.

## Environment Variables

The `render.yaml` automatically configures most environment variables, including database connections and service URLs.

*   `JWT_SECRET`: Automatically generated by Render.
*   `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`: Set to `prod`.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Build Failures**: Check the logs. Ensure the Dockerfiles are correct and dependencies are available.
*   **Database Connection**: Ensure the `creddit-application-service` has the correct `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` injected. The Blueprint handles this, but verify if issues arise.
*   **Port Issues**: The services are configured to listen on specific ports (8080 and 8081). Render should detect this, but if health checks fail, ensure the application logs show it started successfully on the expected port.
